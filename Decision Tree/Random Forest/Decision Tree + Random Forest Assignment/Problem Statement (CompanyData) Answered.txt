Problem Statement:
A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes contributing to high sale.

Approach - A decision tree can be built with target variable 'Sale' (we will first convert it into categorical variable)
 & all other variables will be independent in the analysis.

Answer:
Convert 'Sale' into categorical variable by binning using pd.cut [-1,5,10,15,20] -->['very low' < ' low' < 'medium' < 'high']

Test data :
Predictions   low  medium  very low
