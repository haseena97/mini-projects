I have a dataset containing family information of married couples, which have around 10 variables & 600+ observations. 
Independent variables are ~ gender, age, years married, children, religion etc.
I have one response variable which is number of extra marital affairs.
Now, I want to know what all factors influence the chances of extra marital affair.
Since extra marital affair is a binary variable (either a person will have or not), 
so we can fit logistic regression model here to predict the probability of extra marital affair.
(Please note: Affairs dataset is an inbuilt dataset in R. You have to save the dataset in csv format for Python assignments)

install.packages('AER')
data(Affairs,package="AER")

Answer: (python)
--> Confusion matrix for test data
cnf_test_matrix
Out[30]: 
array([[131,   1],
       [ 44,   5]], dtype=int64)

--> Accuracy score for test data
print(accuracy_score(test_data.affairs2, predict_test > 0.5))
0.7513812154696132

--> Confusion matrix for train data
cnf_train_matrix
Out[35]: 
array([[308,  11],
       [ 90,  11]], dtype=int64)

--> Accuracy score for train data
print(accuracy_score(train_data.affairs2, predict_train > 0.5))
0.7595238095238095
